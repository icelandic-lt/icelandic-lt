| IGC | Dataset | The IGC-project (Icelandic Gigaword Corpus) aims to collect as much as possible of Icelandic texts that can be published, under an open or restricted licence. The project is divided into nine individual corpora. Each corpus comes in two versions. One contains the texts untokenized and untagged where each paragraph is contained inside of a `<p>` tag, while the other one has been tokenized, POS-tagged and lemmatized. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/254 | - | 2022 | - | - | - | - |
| DMII/BÍN | Dataset | This package contains the Comprehensive Format of The Database of Modern Icelandic Inflection - (DMII). DMII is a part of The Database of Icelandic Morphology (DIM). DIM is a multipurpose linguistic resource, created for use in language technology (LT), as a reference for the general public in Iceland, and for use in research on the Icelandic language.  | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/162 | - | 21.10 | - | - | - | - |
| Valency structure database | Dataset | This package contains valency structures that are part of The Database of Icelandic Morphology (DIM) which is a multipurpose linguistic resource, created for use in language technology (LT), as a reference for the general public in Iceland, and for use in research on the Icelandic language. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/163 | - | 21.09 | - | - | - | - |

| Icelandic Wordweb | Dataset | A single RDF file housing the Icelandic Wordweb in an LT-appropriate format. The Wordweb's features have been encoded with OntoLex and SKOS, with the new version designed in such a way as to replicate all core functionality of the original, and offer an extensive suite of new options for inspection and research.| - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/117 | - | 21.06 | - | - | - | - |
| ICC | Dataset | The Icelandic Crawled Corpus (ICC) contains approximately 930M tokens which have been scraped from a selection of Icelandic websites, including news sites, government websites and forums. The scraped text is presented in its original form, unannotated, untokenized and without deduplication. | - | - | https://huggingface.co/datasets/jonfd/ICC | > 1 years | - | - | - | Move to Icelandic-LT Hugging Face site |
| MIM-GOLD | Dataset | MIM-GOLD 21.05 is a gold standard for PoS-tagging and lemmatizing Icelandic texts. This new version contains the same texts as version 20.05 but lemmas have been added and some corrections have been made to the PoS-tagging. The gold standard contains approximately 1 million running words with manually annotated PoS-tags and lemmas. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/113 http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/114 | - | 21.06 | - | - | - | - |

| Icelandic Multi-SimLex | Dataset | MSL, short for Multi-SimLex, is an evaluation protocol and associated dataset for lexical semantics. The original English-language MSL builds on several older, well-known datasets, most notably SimLex-999, and has already been released in a dozen languages. A fully processed MSL dataset consists of 1,888 unordered word pairs, where each pair is tagged with grammatical categories and marked with a numerical score that indicates the words' semantic similarity. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/121 | - | 21.06 | - | - | - | - |
| IceBATS | Dataset | IceBATS is an Icelandic adaptation of the Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS). BATS is intended to evaluate word embeddings based on word analogy tasks. This extensive set demonstrates a language model's ability to recognize various linguistic relations with the use of the vector offset method. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/120 | - | 21.06 | - | - | - | - |
