| Embeddings generation | Software | Scripts for generation of embeddings for the Icelandic language via word2vec, fastText, GloVe including scripts to evaluate trained models | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/ordgreypingar_embeddings) | 3 years | - | - | YES | Where are the models ? |
| Íslenska | Software | Python module that embeds the vocabulary of the Database of Icelandic Morphology (Beygingarlýsing íslensks nútímamáls, BÍN) and offers various lookups and queries of the data. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/BinPackage) | 5 months | - | - | - | - |
| Tokenizer | Software | Python executable program and module for tokenizing Icelandic text. It converts input text to streams of tokens, where each token is a separate word, punctuation sign, number/amount, date, e-mail, URL/URI, etc. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/Tokenizer)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/262) | 22.10 | - | - | - | - |
| ABLTagger | Software | A Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagger and lemmatizer for Icelandic in Python. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/POS)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/115)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/134) | 10 months | - | - | YES | - |
| IceParser | Software | Shallow parser for Icelandic written in Java. The parser comprises a sequence of finite-state transducers, which add syntactic information, in an incremental manner, into the input text. The input to IceParser is part-of-speech (PoS) tagged text and it produces output which includes annotation of both constituent structure and syntactic functions. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/icenlp)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/122) | 21.07 | - | - | - | - |
| GreynirEngine | Software | Python package for working with Icelandic natural language text. Greynir can parse text into sentence trees, find lemmas, inflect noun phrases, assign part-of-speech tags and much more. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/GreynirEngine)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/269) | 7 months | - | - | - | - |
| UDConverter | Software | Python module for converting bracket-parsed PPCHE-format treebanks to the Universal Dependencies framework. The module is specifically configured to convert treebanks in the IcePaHC format, which is based on PPCME. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/UDConverter) | 22.10 | - | - | - | - |
| UDConverter-GreynirCorpus | Software | Tool for converting the constituency treebanks of GreynirCorpus to dependency treebanks following the Universal Dependencies framework | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/UDConverter-GreynirCorpus)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/222) | 22.06 | - | - | - | - |

| Skiptir | Software | A command-line tool that uses Pyphen (https://pyphen.org) to hyphenate text according to the newest hyphenation patterns from the Icelandic Hyphenation Dictionary (http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/86). Can also be used as a module in Python. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/skiptir)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/87) | 20.10 | - | - | - | When used as a module, the GPL-v3 applies and an appropriate comment should be explicitely given ! |
| Alexia | Software | Lexicon Acquisition Tool in Python. ALEXIA is a command-line based corpus tool used for comparing a certain vocabulary to that of a larger corpus or corpora. In order to maintain lexicons, dictionaries and terminologies, it is necessary to be able to systematically go through large amounts of text considered to be representative of the language or category in question in order to find potential gaps in the data. ALEXIA provides an easy way to generate such candidate lists. | [GitHub](https://github.com/icelandic-lt/ALEXIA_ordtokutol)<br>[Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/123) | 21.08 | - | - | - | - |
| IceEval | Software | Benchmark for evaluating and comparing the quality of pre-trained language models. The models are evaluated on a selection of four NLP tasks for Icelandic: part-of-speech tagging (using the MIM-GOLD corpus), named entity recognition (using the MIM-GOLD-NER corpus), dependency parsing (using the IcePaHC-UD corpus) and automatic text summarization (using the IceSum corpus). IceEval includes scripts for downloading the datasets, splitting them into training, validation and test splits and training and evaluating models for each task. | [Clarin.is](http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/297) | - | - | - | - | Move source code to Icelandic LT GitHub repo |
| ConvBert base/small, Electra base/small | Model | Icelandic Language Models, suitable for downstream tasks like Embedding generation, named entity generation (NER), Part of Speech (PoS) tagging, etc.  | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/Icelandic-lt/) | > 2 years | - | - | Jein | Got feedback from jonfd: cleaning and pretraining scripts are clear now. Will add those to the Hugging Face repos. Scripts missing are IGC->BERT Dataset transformation scripts, the procedure is clear though |
