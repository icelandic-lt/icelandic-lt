| Yfirlestur | Software | Web server where a user can enter or submit Icelandic text and have it checked for spelling and grammar errors. The core spelling and grammar checking functionality of is provided by the GreynirCorrect package | https://github.com/icelandic-lt/Yfirlestur | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/266 | - | 22.09 | - | - | - | - |
| GreynirCorrect4LT | Software | Slightly adapted version of GreynirCorrect package. This version is implemented for use in a text-to-speech text pre-processing pipeline and can quickly be adapted to other use cases in language technology applications | https://github.com/icelandic-lt/GreynirCorrect4LT | - | - | 2 years | - | - | - | - |
| Réttritun | Software | Réttritun is a spell checker that provides spell and grammar correction for Icelandic on Android devices. Spell checking is made via API calls over the Internet to a self-hosted Yfirlestur web service. | https://github.com/icelandic-lt/simacorrect | - | - | 2 years | - | - | - | - |
| AnySoftKeyboard / Icelandic language pack | Software | Plugin for Icelandic language pack for the AnySoft Android Keyboard project. This language pack has been mainlined and is now part of the official AnySoftKeyboard. | https://github.com/AnySoftKeyboard/AnySoftKeyboard | - | - | 2 weeks | - | - | - | Upstreamed work to Anysoft Keyboard |
| AnySoftKeyboard fork | Software | This version contains a new autocompleter module based on finite-state-transducers (FST) as implemented in the Apache Lucene library. The autocompleter uses a bigram list from the Icelandic Gigaword Corpus (ICG) to enable next word suggestions from the beginning and not just after the user has used the keyboard for a certain amount of time, as implemented in the original keyboard and upstreamed version. This version, however, still learns from the user, enhancing the original list with usage data and boosting frequently used combinations. | https://github.com/grammatek/AnySoftKeyboard/tree/v1.0.0-gt | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/290 | - | 22.10 | - | - | - | move fork over from Grammatek to Icelandic-Lt |

| OCR Post-processing tool | Software | Transformer models to correct OCR errors, along with ca 50,000 line pairs of OCRed/corrected text. The models were trained on ca 900,000 lines (~7,000,000 tokens) of which only 50,000 (~400,000 tokens) were from real OCRed texts. | https://github.com/icelandic-lt/ocr-post-processing | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/271 | - | 22.10 | - | - | - | Git-lfs problems when downloading because of quota problems, need to manually fix |

| T5 Byte-Level Model | Model | This Byte-Level Neural Error Correction Model for Icelandic is a fine-tuned byT5-base Transformer model for error correction in natural language. It acts as a machine translation model in that it “translates” from deficient Icelandic to correct Icelandic. The model is an improved version of a previous model.  | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/324 | - | 24.03 | - | - | NO | No training / dataset preparation / evaluation scripts.

| Nonwords, systematic errors | Dataset | A list of automatically prepared word forms containing systematic errors along with their corrections. All words are nonwords, i.e. they do not exist in Icelandic. All of the word forms are created by making substitutions commonly made by Icelandic informants, wherein a letter is replaced with another letter which sounds the same or does or does not have an accent. | - | http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12537/50 | - | 20.09 | - | - | - | - |
